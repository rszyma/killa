v0.1.0 killa milestone - all features:
one page view with processes list. clone the looks from gnome-system-monitor
take the info from bottom crate
iced for gui lib
iced_table for table

ctrl+f for search
- up/down arrows always work within that context (and infact without any context)
- always select first option
enter to show details
    - and provide the output with just plain-text read-only inputbox, so it's easy to copy all info.
- esc clears search, but keeps selection (or not? ig, will need to test)
some shortcut to open submenu with sorting? or just use 1,2,3,4,5 for name,cpu,mem,pid,time
    - due to the fact that program names usually don't contain number, by default clicking numbers won't trigger search,
    - while letters do (but don't really focus the input for inputting letters, only focus on click of the "toggle numbers search" Â 
      button next to search input)
- 789 numbers to trigger different views (graphs, processes, disks(?).. I'm just listin what gnome has..)
- after sorting, jump to first entry
- ctrl+, to trigger options
- options ideally can be imported/exported, so it works well with nix
    - another idea is for options to export git patch since last change (lmao),
      and you can indicate where to what nix file to apply the patch

pretty urgent todo (in order)
- [ ] show total memory usage in % at top bar
- [ ] sort secondary values (those that are currently 0% cpu) in order of earlier being higher.

# versions 0.2.0-and-later:
process icons (like in gsm)
color cpu/mem in red more, higher the usage (smth like )
